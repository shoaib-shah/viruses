            <h2>What are Enteroviruses?</h2>
            <p>Enteroviruses are a group of viruses that primarily affect the gastrointestinal tract but can also impact other systems of the body, including the nervous system, skin, and heart. These viruses belong to the Picornavirus family and include several different types.</p>
            <div class="extra-info">
                <p><strong>Common Types of Enteroviruses:</strong> The main types of enteroviruses include Poliovirus, Coxsackieviruses, Echoviruses, Enterovirus D68, and Enterovirus A71, each responsible for different diseases and health problems.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Common Diseases Caused by Enteroviruses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Polio</strong>: Poliovirus can cause paralysis and, in severe cases, death.</li>
                <li><strong>Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease</strong>: Caused by Coxsackievirus and Enterovirus A71, characterized by a rash and sores in the mouth.</li>
                <li><strong>Viral Meningitis</strong>: Caused by Coxsackievirus and Echovirus, leading to inflammation around the brain and spinal cord.</li>
                <li><strong>Respiratory Illnesses</strong>: Enterovirus D68 can cause severe respiratory problems, especially in children.</li>
                <li><strong>Myocarditis</strong>: Inflammation of the heart muscle due to enterovirus infections.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="extra-info">
                <p><strong>Other complications:</strong> Some enteroviruses can also cause myocarditis (heart inflammation), pericarditis (inflammation of the lining around the heart), and conjunctivitis (eye infections).</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of enterovirus infections can vary depending on the virus and the affected area of the body. Some common symptoms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fever</li>
                <li>Sore throat</li>
                <li>Rash</li>
                <li>Muscle pain</li>
                <li>Abdominal pain</li>
                <li>Vomiting or diarrhea</li>
                <li>Severe headache</li>
                <li>Stiff neck (if meningitis is present)</li>
                <li>Respiratory distress (in severe cases)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Transmission</h2>
            <p>Enteroviruses are typically spread through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fecal-oral route:</strong> Enteroviruses are often transmitted by contaminated food or water or by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth.</li>
                <li><strong>Respiratory droplets:</strong> Coughing or sneezing can spread respiratory enteroviruses to others.</li>
                <li><strong>Direct contact:</strong> Close personal contact, such as shaking hands, hugging, or kissing someone infected, can transmit the virus.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Prevention</h2>
            <p>While there is no specific vaccine for all enterovirus infections (except polio), there are measures you can take to reduce your risk:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice good hygiene, including frequent handwashing with soap and water.</li>
                <li>Avoid close contact with infected individuals, especially during outbreaks.</li>
                <li>Disinfect surfaces regularly, especially in households with children or sick individuals.</li>
                <li>Use tissues or elbows to cover coughs and sneezes.</li>
                <li>If traveling to areas with known outbreaks, avoid consuming contaminated food and water.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>There is no specific antiviral treatment for most enterovirus infections, but supportive care can help manage symptoms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rest and hydration to support the body's immune response.</li>
                <li>Over-the-counter medications (like acetaminophen) to reduce fever and relieve pain.</li>
                <li>For severe cases, hospitalization may be required, especially for viral meningitis or respiratory distress.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="extra-info">
                <p><strong>For Polio:</strong> The polio vaccine is the primary prevention method for poliovirus, which can lead to paralysis and permanent disability. It's important to maintain vaccination schedules to prevent polio.</p>
