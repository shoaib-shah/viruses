      <h1>what is Flavivirus</h1>
      <h5><br>
      is a genus of the family Flaviviridae. It includes West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and several other viruses which lead to extensive morbidity and mortality in humans. To establish infection and replication in the hosts, flaviviruses have evolved a variety of strategies to modulate the host's immune responses. In this review, the strategies employed by flaviviruses to evade the innate and adaptive immunity of host are summarized based on current studies, with a major focus on the inhibition of interferon, complement, natural killer (NK) cell, B cell, and T cell responses. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding for the mechanisms used by flaviviruses to escape the host's immune response, which will facilitate the future studies on flavivirus pathogenesis and the development of anti-flavivirus therapeutics.

      <h5>
      The flavivirus are emerging and re-emerging arthropod-borne pathogens responsible for significant mortality and morbidity worldwide. The genus comprises more than 70 viruses, and despite genomic and structural similarities, infections by different flaviviruses result in different clinical presentations. In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine against these infections, the search for new strategies to inhibit viral infection is necessary.
      <br><br>
      The life cycle of arboviruses begins with the entry process composed of multiple steps: attachment, internalization, endosomal escape and capsid uncoating. This mini-review describes factors and mechanisms involved in the viral entry as events required to take over the cellular machinery and host factors and cellular pathways commonly used by flaviviruses as possible approaches for developing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.

      <h5> Flaviviruses are enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses that belong, together with the Hepaci- and Pestiviruses, to the family of the Flaviviridae. The genus Flavivirus contains (i) viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks (arthropod-borne) and (ii) viruses with no known vector (NKV) (Chambers et al., 1990) (Fig. 1). Currently, more than 70 flaviviruses have been reported. All flaviviruses of human importance belong to the arthropod-borne group. The NKV-group holds a few viruses which have been isolated from mice or bats and for which no arthropod-borne or natural route of transmission has (yet) been demonstrated (Kuno et al., 1998).

      <h5> Flaviviruses are emerging arthropod-borne RNA viruses, causing a broad spectrum of life-threatening disease symptoms such as encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever. Successful vaccines exist against yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus. However, vaccine development against other flaviviruses like dengue virus is not straightforward. This is partly because of the high sequence conservation and immunological cross-reactivity among flavivirus envelope glycoproteins leading to antibody mediated enhancement of disease. A comprehensive analyses of the structural landscape of humoral immune response against flaviviruses is crucial for antigen design. Here, we compare the available structural data of several flavivirus antibody complexes with a major focus on Zika virus and dengue virus and discuss the mapped epitopes, the stoichiometry of antibody binding and mechanisms of neutralization.

      <h4>Introduction</h4><br><br>
      <h5>Flaviviruses are a large group of medically relevant viruses that cause significant disease in humans and animals. These include dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) [1,2]. Flavivirus virions contain the structural proteins, an envelope as well as a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 11 kb in length. The incoming flavivirus genome encodes a single open reading frame that is translated on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into a single polyprotein. This polyprotein is subsequently cleaved into three structural proteins (capsid, prM and envelope) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) by viral and host proteases. The structural proteins form the viral particles, while the non-structural proteins are required for intracellular viral propagation and immune evasion [1,2]. <br><br>
     
      
      Given their limited protein repertoire, flaviviruses rely on the host cell machinery for many steps in their life cycle. Identification of host proteins that are required for viral replication can inform the development of effective host-directed therapeutics and new innate antiviral mechanisms. Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics have increased the sensitivity and specificity and allow for the systematic identification and quantification of proteins in a high-throughput manner (Box 1) [3]. This technology is being widely used in many fields, and has been used to identify host proteins that are involved in viral replication including flaviviral infection (Figure 1). Here, we review how proteomic approaches have improved our understanding of flavivirus–host interactions, highlighting the mechanisms by which flaviviruses manipulate host cellular processes to promote infection. <br><br>
      
      Box 1 <br><br>
      Different types of proteomics approaches discussed in this review </h5><br><br>
      
      <h4> Affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS):</h4><br><br>
     
      <h5>AP-MS is a powerful technique to identify binding partners of a target protein. Affinity-tagged protein of interest is purified as bait and its associated prey proteins are analyzed by mass spectrometry.
      </h5><br><br>
      
      <h4>Comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS):</h4><br><br>
      
      <h5>ChIRP-MS is novel technique to study RNA-protein interactions. RNA-protein complexes are crosslinked and purified by biotinylated anti-sense oligonucleotides against RNA of interest. The RNA-associated proteins are subsequently identified by mass spectrometry.
      </h5><br><br>
      
      <h4> RNA affinity chromatography combined with MS:</h4><br><br>
     
      <h5>RNA affinity chromatography combined with MS is a widely used method to identify RNA-binding proteins that interact with specific RNA sequences. Tagged RNA (e.g. biotin tag, tobramycin and streptomycin aptamer tag) is used to isolate RNA-protein complexes and the bound proteins are eluted for mass spectrometry analysis.
      </h5><br><br>
      
      <h4>Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based MS:</h4><br><br>
      
      <h5>SILAC is a proteomic technique for quantification of proteins from different samples using non-radioactive isotopic labeling. Two cell populations are labeled with normal amino acids (light label) or isotopic modified amino acids (heavy label), respectively. Heavy and light cell lysates are combined and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. The ratio of peak intensities in the mass spectrum corresponds to the protein abundance.
      </h5><br><br>
      
      <h4>MS-based phosphoproteomics:</h4><br><br>
      
      <h5> MS-based phosphoproteomics is a powerful tool for identification of proteins with phosphorylation as a post-translational modification. The protein samples are digested into peptides and phosphopeptides with trypsin. Phosphopeptides are enriched via the affinity of phosphate groups towards metals (e.g. Fe3+, Ti4+ ions) on carrier resins. The enriched phosphopeptides are then quantified by mass spectrometry.
      </h5><br><br>
     
      <h4> MS-based proteomics for identification of ubiquitination sites:</h4><br><br>
     
      <h5>Protein ubiquitination sites can be identified by MS through enrichment of the di-glycine remnant that is generated following trypsin digestion of ubiquitinated proteins. The resultant ubiquitin-remnant-containing peptides can be enriched by a diglycine-specific antibody and the ubiquitination sites are identified by mass spectrometry. It is important to note that this method also enriches for the peptide remnants of proteins modified by Nedd8 and ISG15, which cannot be distinguished by this method.

    <h4>Viruses and Kidney Disease</h4><br><br>
      <h6> Emmanuel A. Burdmann, in 
      Advances in Chronic Kidney Disease
      , 2019</h6><br><br>
     <h5>The genus Flavivirus comprises approximately 73 viruses, which share several common aspects, such as dimension, structure, nucleic acid properties, and shape in electronic microscopy. Global incidence of flavivirus infection increased dramatically over the last decades, causing large outbreaks in several areas of the world. These viruses are expanding from endemic tropical and subtropical areas to previously nonendemic areas, affecting and causing diseases in millions of individuals worldwide and posing a formidable challenge to public health in several countries. The majority of clinically significant flavivirus-associated infections are mosquito borne (arboviruses—acronym for ARthropod-BOrne VIRUSES), such as dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and West Nile fever. Most diseases caused by flaviviruses are asymptomatic or manifest as self-limited, mild, undifferentiated febrile diseases. In a limited number of cases, these diseases may evolve to severe inflammatory, multisystem diseases, causing high morbidity and mortality. Some flaviviruses have been consistently identified in kidney tissue and urine and have been clinically associated with kidney diseases. In this review, we will provide an overview of the epidemiology, risk factors, kidney pathology, etiopathogenesis, and outcomes of acute and chronic kidney syndromes associated with dengue, yellow fever, Zika, and West Nile virus disease.

      <h4>The machinery for flavivirus fusion with host cell membranes</h4><br><br>
      <h6>  Franz X Heinz, Steven L Allison, in 
      Current Opinion in Microbiology
      , 2001</h6><br><br>
    
      <h5>Flaviviruses are small, icosahedral enveloped viruses that constitute a genus within the family flaviviridae, which also includes the genera pestivirus and hepacivirus (human hepatitis C viruses). Several flaviviruses are important mosquito- or tick-borne human pathogens, such as the yellow fever, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) viruses. Mature virions contain three proteins, designated C (capsid), E (envelope) and M (membrane) proteins (Fig. 1). The E protein is the major constituent of the virion surface and has the dual function of binding cell receptors and mediating low-pH-triggered membrane fusion in the endosome. Virus assembly takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum and first leads to the generation of fusion-incompetent, immature virions in which the E protein forms a stable heterodimeric complex with precursor of M (prM; Fig. 1). Immature virions are transported through the cellular endocytotic pathway and, shortly before their release, prM is cleaved by furin or a related protease in the trans-Golgi network to generate fusion-competent mature infectious virions. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge regarding the structural basis of flavivirus fusion and how this fusion machinery relates to the class I fusion proteins and to the fusion machinery of the alphaviruses, another group of icosahedral enveloped viruses with class II viral fusion proteins.

      <a href=""><h3>Role of the complement system in antibody-dependent enhancement of flavivirus infections</h3></a><br><br>
      
      <h6> Alana B. Byrne, Laura B. Talarico, in 
      International Journal of Infectious Diseases
      , 2021</h6><br><br>
     <h4>Introduction</h4><br><br>
      
      <h5> Flaviviruses are insect-borne, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that include human pathogens of major health concern, including yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Flaviviruses are responsible for endemic and epidemic disease across six continents (Pierson and Diamond, 2013). DENV comprises four recognized serotypes, whereas YFV, ZIKV, WNV and JEV compose a single antigenic serotype (Pierson and Diamond, 2013). Flavivirus infections may be asymptomatic or produce a broad clinical spectrum of symptoms ranging from high fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, myalgia and arthralgia; in some cases, infection can progress into severe illness such as hemorrhagic fever, meningoencephalitis and neurological complications (Chong et al., 2019). <br><br>
      
      At present, there are licensed effective vaccines for YFV and JEV. A tetravalent DENV vaccine (CYD-TDV) was licensed in 2016, but has been recommended only for prevention of severe secondary disease in seropositive individuals after long-term studies showed enhanced disease as vaccine antibody titers waned in seronegative individuals (Deng et al., 2020; Halstead, 2017). No vaccines are currently available for ZIKV or WNV. Careful studies of the immune response to flaviviruses may help to evolve effective strategies for vaccine development and therapeutic approaches. <br><br>
      
      The flavivirus virion accesses target cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis releasing an RNA genome that is transcribed into a single polyprotein and cleaved into three structural proteins, the capsid (C), envelope (E) and membrane/pre-membrane (M/prM) proteins and seven non-structural proteins, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5. The E protein is comprised of three distinct domains (DI–DIII) connected by flexible hinges and a transmembrane anchor. Viral replication and assembly is carried out in the cytoplasm through interactions of both cellular proteins and viral nonstructural proteins. After transport through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), prM is processed by furin to the mature M protein during secretion in the trans Golgi compartment to produce mature infectious virions (Clyde et al., 2006). Peak viremia occurs during the acute phase of infection, while severe manifestations usually associated with defervescence occur several days after the viremic peak (2009). Acute infection is also characterized by secretion of the viral protein NS1, which is sufficient to produce endothelial hyperpermeability, even in the absence of infection (Glasner et al., 2018). Differences in ZIKV, YFV, DENV and WNV NS1 proteins may contribute to viral tropism, since these proteins promote vascular leakage in a tissue-dependent manner reflective of severe manifestations of these diseases (Puerta-Guardo et al., 2019). <br><br>
      
      Severe flavivirus disease has been associated with multiple immunopathogenic mechanisms (Halstead, 2014; Slon Campos et al., 2018). Cross-reactivity between DENV serotypes and between other flaviviruses has been linked to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of flavivirus secondary infections (Chan et al., 2016; Guzman et al., 2013; Halstead et al., 1980; Katzelnick et al., 2017; Katzelnick et al., 2020). Antibody-dependent enhancement occurs when poorly neutralizing or sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibodies bind to the virion and increase the efficiency of viral attachment and entry into myeloid cells through interactions between the Fc portion of the antibody and Fcγ receptor (FcγR), resulting in increased viral replication and the promotion of immunocomplex-dependent cell signaling that increase cell permissiveness (Chan et al., 2019; Guzman et al., 2013; Pierson and Diamond, 2015). The activation of serotype cross-reactive memory T cells also plays an immunopathogenic role in secondary DENV infections, leading to dysregulated production of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators that can further increase vascular permeability (Rothman, 2011; Shresta, 2012). <br><br>
      
      The complement system has been reported to play an important role in flavivirus infections, exerting both pathogenic and protective effects (Conde et al., 2017). The complement system represents a central part of innate immunity. It is composed of more than 50 plasma proteins produced mainly by the liver and membrane-expressed receptors and regulators, which operate in plasma, in tissues and within cells (Merle et al., 2015a). Complement was first discovered because of its ability to induce bacterial lysis. Over the years, complement’s key role in homeostasis, innate-immune connection and antiviral immunity became evident. Several complement proteins normally circulate in blood as inactive precursors and collaborate as a cascade to opsonize pathogens, induce a series of inflammatory responses that modulate the activity of B and T cells, contribute to the clearance of immune complexes and maintain homeostasis (Merle et al., 2015b). <br><br>
      
      This review aims to provide a comprehensive and updated overview of the role of the complement system in flavivirus infections, with special focus on ADE of flavivirus infections. <br><br>

They are spherical lipid enveloped RNA viruses with single core protein and 2–3 virus-coded glycoproteins. In case of Flavivirus, Hepacivirus and Pegivirus families, 2 envelope proteins are present. However, 3 envelope proteins are present in pestivirus family viruses (Lindenbach et al., 2013; Simmonds et al., 2017).

      <h4>Introduction</h4><br><br>
    <h5>
      
      Flaviviruses (family Flaviviridae) are medically important human pathogens that can cause a range of severe disease symptoms including hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis, depending on the viral species [1]. Flaviviruses have a transmission cycle involving vertebrate amplifying hosts and invertebrate vectors, mostly mosquitoes or ticks. Therefore, like all other arthropod-borne (arbo)viruses, flaviviruses rely on active virus replication and amplification within the vector to establish a productive transmission cycle in nature [2]. This intrinsic, promiscuous ability to replicate in cells of vertebrate as well as invertebrate origin has the implication that the virus encounters very different antiviral strategies and immune responses. In vertebrates, the powerful but aspecific innate, interferon-based immune response combined with the slower but highly specific adaptive immunity keeps viruses in check. In the arthropod, however, adaptive immunity is believed to be absent and control of viral infections solely relies on an innate immune response, in particular RNA interference (RNAi) (reviewed in [3,4,5••]). <br><br>
      
      Here, I will highlight the progress in our understanding of antiviral RNAi during flavivirus infections, with an emphasis on studies carried out with West Nile virus, which cycles between birds and mosquitoes. Although severe WNV disease is observed in humans and horses, these are incidental dead-end hosts and do not partake in WNV transmission [6]. Furthermore, I will discuss the potential role of non-coding, subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA; comprehensive review by [7••]) produced by all members of the Flavivirus genus, in counteracting antiviral RNAi. <br>
