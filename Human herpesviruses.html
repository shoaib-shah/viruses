      <h5> Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)
        Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes oral herpes, genital herpes and infections in other areas of your body. Fluid-filled blisters on your skin are common symptoms, but many people have no symptoms at all. A simple blood test can tell you if you have HSV in your body. Antiviral medications can treat single outbreaks or help you manage HSV long-term.

      <h2> <b> Overview</b> </h2> <br> 
       <h3> <b>What is herpes simplex virus?</b></h3>
        <h5>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can infect many different parts of your body, most commonly your mouth area (oral herpes) and genitals (genital herpes). HSV causes fluid-filled blisters that break open and crust over wherever the infection is. This is known as a herpes outbreak. But it’s also possible to have no symptoms and not realize you’re infected.
        
        HSV is highly contagious. It spreads from person to person through skin-to-skin contact. A herpes simplex infection occurs when the virus enters your body through your skin and mucous membranes (mucosa). The virus uses your cells to make copies of itself (replication).

<h1>Types of herpes simplex virus</h1>
<h5> There are two types of herpes simplex virus: <br>

<br> . Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). <br>
. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). <br>
<br> Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause oral herpes or genital herpes. They also cause infections in other areas of your body. </h5>

<h2><b>What parts of the body does HSV affect?</b></h2>
<h5> Herpes simplex virus can cause infections in your: <br>

<br> <b>. Mouth and face.</b> <br> An oral herpes infection causes cold sores on your lips and around your mouth. Some people develop herpetic gingivostomatitis (sores inside their mouths and other symptoms) when they first get infected. Rarely, sores develop on or inside your nose (nasal herpes). <br>
<br> <b>. Genitals.</b>  <br>A genital herpes infection causes sores in your genital area, including the parts you can see (like your vulva or penis) and those you can’t see (like your cervix). <br>
<br><b>. Skin on other areas of your body.</b> <br> HSV can infect your fingers (herpetic whitlow) or skin anywhere on your body (herpes gladiatorum). Eczema herpeticum, a widespread skin infection, is a complication of HSV infection that affects people with atopic dermatitis. <br>
<br> <b>. Eyes.</b> <br> HSV can cause a serious eye infection called herpes keratitis (a type of ocular herpes). <br>
<br> <b>.  Brain and spinal cord.</b> <br> HSV can infect your brain (herpes simplex encephalitis) or the protective layers surrounding your brain and spinal cord (herpes meningitis). If HSV infects both your brain and its protective layers, you can develop a life-threatening condition called herpes meningoencephalitis. <br>
<br> <b>.  Other organs.</b> <br> HSV can affect one or more organs in your chest and belly, including your esophagus (herpes esophagitis), lungs (HSV pneumonia) and liver (HSV hepatitis). These types of infections are more likely to affect people who are immunocompromised. <br>
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can infect many different parts of your body, causing bumps and fluid-filled blisters to appear
HSV can infect many different parts of your body, including your eyes, mouth area, genital area and fingers. <br>

<br> <h1><b>Symptoms and Causes</b></h1> <br>
<h2> What are the symptoms of a herpes simplex infection?</h2><br>
<h5>The symptoms of an HSV infection vary according to the specific type of infection: <br>

<br> <b>. Oral herpes.</b> <br> Blisters on your lips or around your mouth. Skin may tingle, itch or burn up to 48 hours before blisters appear. <br>
Genital herpes.  <br>Blisters on and around your genitals. Symptoms in the 48 hours leading up to blisters appearing include fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes and itching or tingling in your genital area. <br>
<br><b>. Herpes gladiatorum.</b> <br> Blisters anywhere on your skin but usually your hands, face, ears or chest. <br>
<br><b>. Herpetic whitlow.</b> <br> Blisters on your fingers, discolored skin around your fingernail, swelling in your finger. <br>
<br><b>. Herpes keratitis (eye herpes).</b> <br> Eye pain or irritation, feeling like there’s something in your eye, sensitivity to light, blisters on your eyelids or around your eyes. <br> 
<br><b>. HSV encephalitis.</b> <br> Headache, fever, focal seizures, changes in speech or behavior. <br>
<br><b>. Herpes meningitis.</b> <br> Headache, fever, sensitivity to light. <br></h5>
<br> <h1><b>How do you get an HSV infection?</b></h1> 
<br> <h5> You catch HSV through direct contact with someone who has an HSV infection. This means part of your body needs to touch someone else’s: <br>

<br>. Herpes sores (oral or genital).<br>
<br>.  Skin or mucosal surfaces (like mouth, vagina or <b>anus</b>), with or without visible sores. <br>
<br>.  <b>Saliva</b>, semen or <b> vaginal discharge</b>, with or without signs of an infection. <br>
<br> Someone with HSV doesn’t transmit (or “shed”) the virus from every part of their body. They only shed it from the area that’s infected. Usually, that’s the part of their body where HSV first entered. <br>

<br> <b> For example</b>, someone with genital herpes can transmit the virus through the skin, mucosa and bodily fluids in their genital area only. They won’t spread HSV through their saliva — the exception, of course, is if they also have oral herpes (we’ll return to this later). <br>

<br> Similarly, if your partner has oral herpes but not genital herpes, then you don’t have to worry about getting HSV from contact with their genitals. You’d only be at risk of catching HSV through contact with your partner’s mouth or saliva. <br>

<br>If your partner has both oral and genital herpes, then it’s possible you could catch HSV from contact with their mouth area or their genital area. But exactly how the virus affects you would depend on which part of your body made that contact. This deserves a closer look. <br>



<br> <h1><b>Herpes simplex incubation period</b></h1> <br>
<h5>The incubation period for herpes simplex infections ranges from one to 26 days but is typically six to eight days. This is how long it takes for you to develop symptoms after first getting infected with HSV. <br>

<br> Some people get infected but don’t develop symptoms right away. Instead, symptoms may not appear for months or even years until the virus reactivates. <br> </h5>

<h2><b>What triggers herpes simplex virus?</b></h2> 
<h5>Triggers that may cause an oral or genital herpes outbreak include: <br>

<br>. Fever. <br>
<br>. Stress. <br>
<br>. Suppressed immune system (due to medications or an underlying condition). <br>
<br>. Changes in hormones (for example, during menstruation). <br>

<br> Potential triggers specific to oral herpes include: <br>

<br>.  Sun exposure. <br>
<br>. Upper respiratory infection. <br>
<br>. Trauma to your mouth area. <br>
<br>. Outbreaks can also occur randomly without any obvious trigger. <br></h5>

<br> <h2><b>What are the stages of a herpes simplex infection?</b></h2>
<h5>  An HSV infection has three stages:  <br>

<br>.  Primary infection. <br>
<br>.  Latency. <br>
<br>. Reactivation. <br> </h5>
<br> <h2><b>HSV primary infection</b></h2>  <br>
<h5>A “primary infection” is what happens after HSV enters your body. The virus travels to nearby nerve cells, where it starts replicating. When HSV enters your mouth, it typically infects your trigeminal nerves. When it enters your genital area, it typically infects your sacral plexus (a network of nerves in your pelvis). <br>

<br> HSV then travels through your nerves to nearby skin or mucosa. By this point, your immune system recognizes there’s an invader, and it starts sending out immune cells. This leads to inflammation and the formation of blisters on your skin. You may also notice swollen lymph nodes in that area (for example, underneath your jaw or along your groin). <br>

<br>For some people, a primary infection causes no symptoms and they’re unaware they’re infected with HSV. <br> </h5>

<br> <h3><b>HSV latency</b></h3>
<h5>Within a few weeks, your immune system clears up the primary infection, but HSV stays in the nerve cells it first infected. Healthcare providers refer to this as latency. It means the virus is present in your nerve cells but mostly inactive (you might hear this described as the virus being “asleep”). <br>

<br>During latency, most of the infected cells are sleeping, but a few are awake at any given time. Usually, this doesn’t cause an outbreak. Sometimes, infected cells “wake up” and cause enough of a stir that your immune system notices. This is HSV reactivation. <br></h5>

<br><h3><b>HSV reactivation</b></h3> 
<h5>Reactivation is when infected cells wake up and trigger an immune response. There are a few possibilities at this point:  <br>

<br><b>.  Containment in nerve tissue.</b> There’s brief HSV activity but it begins and ends in your nerve cells. Your immune system contains the virus before it can travel to your skin or mucosa. This happens often in people with HSV — the virus wakes up, has a quick burst of activity (lasting about two to six hours) and then that’s it. You don’t shed the virus or have symptoms, and you don’t spread HSV to others. <br>
<br><b>. Asymptomatic viral shedding.</b>  Some infected cells reach the outer layer of your skin (epidermis). There’s not enough viral activity to cause symptoms, but the virus may “shed.” This means the virus can leave your skin and infect someone else through direct contact. HSV commonly spreads from person to person during this shedding period. <br>
<br><b>. Symptomatic herpes outbreak.</b> The infected cells replicate enough at your skin’s surface to cause symptoms. This is when you notice blisters on your skin, and it’s what most people associate with a herpes outbreak. The virus can easily spread to others through direct contact.  <br> </h5>
<br>   <h1><b>Diagnosis and Tests</b></h1> <br>
<h2>How do healthcare providers diagnose HSV infections?</h2> <br> 
<h5>Healthcare providers diagnose HSV infections by doing a <b>physical exam</b> and testing. During an exam, your provider will look for signs of infection (like sores). They may take a sample from the sores to send for lab testing. If your provider suspects encephalitis and/or meningitis, they may do a <b>  </b>.  <br>

<br> If you don’t have sores, your provider can use a <b>blood test </b>to check for <b> antibodies against</b> HSV-1 or HSV-2. Antibodies are a sign you’ve been infected with the virus in the past. Test results help your provider plan treatment. <br>
