            <h2 class="card-title">What is human papillomavirus (HPV)?</h2><br>
            <p class="card-text" ><h5>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common virus that can affect different parts of your body. There are over 100 types of HPV, including strains of HPV that cause warts on your hands, feet and face. About 30 HPV strains can affect your genitals, including your vulva, vagina, cervix, penis and scrotum, as well as your rectum and anus. This includes the type of HPV that causes genital warts. <br><br>
                HPV that affects your genitals is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that gets passed through skin-to-skin contact, most often during sexual activities. Many people cringe at the thought of STIs, but most genital HPV strains are harmless. <br><br>

                HPV is the most common viral STI in the United States. Roughly 14 million people get the infection each year. HPV is so common that most sexually active people who aren’t vaccinated against HPV will become infected at some point in their lives. Most never know they have it. <br><br>

                    Some strains of HPV are high-risk and can lead to cancers, like cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers. Early detection (with a Pap smear or HPV screening) and treatment of precancerous cells can usually prevent this from happening.

      <h2>How is HPV related to cervical cancer?</h2> <br>
      <h5>Certain strains of HPV (most often types 16 and 18) can cause changes in the cells of your cervix, a condition called cervical dysplasia. Left untreated, cervical dysplasia sometimes advances to cervical cancer. <br><br>

        If you’re under 30, most HPV infections clear up on their own. By age 30, finding HPV during a Pap smear can determine how often you should receive follow-up testing. If you test positive, you may be at a higher risk and need more frequent testing. <br><br>
        
        Getting regular Pap smears to screen for cervical cancer is important (usually beginning at age 21). But it’s important to remember that just because you have HPV or cervical dysplasia doesn’t mean you’ll get cancer. <br><br></h5>


        <h2>How long does it take for HPV to turn into cancer?</h2> <br>
        <h5>The virus itself doesn’t turn into cancer. But high-risk strains of HPV infection can cause precancerous cell changes. These cell changes can eventually lead to cancer if they aren’t managed. This process, though, can take years or decades to happen. Screenings, like Pap smears, can help detect these precancerous cells before they turn to cancer.</h5>

        <br><br>

        <h1>Symptoms and Causes</h1><br>
        <h2>What are the symptoms of HPV?</h2><br>
        <h5>HPV that affects your genitals doesn’t usually cause symptoms. When symptoms do occur, the most common sign of the virus is warts in your genital area. Genital warts are rough, cauliflower-like lumps that grow on your skin. They may also appear like skin tags. They may appear weeks, months or even years after you’ve been infected with low-risk HPV. Genital warts are contagious (like all forms of HPV). They can also be itchy and very uncomfortable. <br><br>

            High-risk forms of HPV often don’t cause symptoms until they’ve progressed to cancer.
        </h5><br><br>


        <h2>Are all warts HPV?</h2><br>
        <h5>Yes. And this can be confusing — especially when you’re trying to understand the difference between the HPV that causes the wart on your finger or genitals and the HPV that may lead to cervical cancer. <br><br>

            The HPV strains that cause warts, including genital warts, are nuisances. After all, no one wants warts, least of all on their genitals. Still, these types of HPV are harmless. HPV types 6 and 11 most often cause genital warts. Other types of HPV cause warts on other parts of your body. These warts are: <br><br>
            
            Flat warts. <br><br>
            Plantar warts. <br><br>
            Periungal and subungual warts. <br><br>
            All warts are caused by HPV, but not all strains or types of HPV cause warts. The type of HPV that can progress to cancer doesn’t cause warts.</h5>
            <br><br>

            <h2>Flat warts.</h2><br>
            <h5>Flat warts are smooth, small bumps on your skin. They’re flatter and smaller than other warts and usually appear in groups on your face or hands. Four different strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV) cause flat warts. Flat warts don’t usually require treatment. They’ll usually go away on their own, but it may take several months or even years.</h5>
            <br><br>

            <h2>Plantar warts.</h2><br>
            <h5>Plantar warts are a type of skin infection on your feet caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The infection causes rough bumps to form, which may be uncomfortable or painful. Treatment options include home remedies, medications and therapies.</h5>
            <br><br>


            <h2>How do you spread HPV?</h2><br>
            <h5>Genital HPV spreads through skin-to-skin contact during intercourse, oral sex and anal sex. You can get the infection if your genitals — including your vulva, vagina, penis and scrotum, as well as your rectum and anus — come into contact with these same body parts on an infected partner. <br><br>

                It’s possible to spread the virus through hand-to-genital contact, like fingering and handjobs. This type of transmission is less likely and less is known about it as compared to genital-to-genital contact.</h5><br><br>


                <h2>How easy is it to spread HPV?</h2>
                <h5>HPV is highly contagious, in part, because it’s transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. You don’t have to exchange body fluids with someone for you to contract the virus or spread it to someone else. You can infect your partner, or your partner can infect you even if no one ejaculates.</h5> <br>

                <h2>Who does HPV affect?</h2>
                <h5>Anyone can become infected with HPV if they have sex or close skin-to-skin genital contact with a partner with the virus. Similarly, anyone with the virus can spread it to their partner during intercourse, oral sex, anal sex or other close genital contact. <br><br>

                    If you’re HIV positive, your immune system may have a harder time fighting HPV infections. If you’re a person with a penis who has sex with other people with penises, you may be at greater risk of contracting high-risk HPV strains that can progress to cancer. In this case, your provider may recommend an anal Pap test. Anal Pap tests don’t test for HPV, but they can test for cell changes that may lead to cancer. Ask your healthcare provider if you should get tested. <br><br>
                    
                    Regardless of your reproductive anatomy, it’s important to prevent the spread of HPV by getting vaccinated and by practicing safer sex (correct and consistent use of condoms or dental dams). </h5> <br><br>
                    
                    <h3>HPV in people assigned female at birth </h3><br><br>
                   <h5> In general, HPV poses the greatest risk to women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB) because high-risk HPV can progress to cervical cancer if it’s not treated. Pap smears and HPV tests can detect precancerous cell changes early to prevent cancer in your cervix. HPV can also cause genital warts in people AFAB. </h5> <br><br>
                    
                   <h3> HPV in people assigned men at birth </h3><br><br>
                  <h5>  HPV poses fewer health risks to men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB). If you’re AMAB, HPV can cause genital warts, but most infections clear on their own. HPV can lead to cancers of your penis, anus, head and neck, but these cancers are rare. As a result, HPV tests and Pap tests aren’t generally recommended for people who are AMAB.</h5><br><br>
