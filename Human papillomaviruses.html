            <h2 class="card-title">What is human papillomavirus (HPV)?</h2><br>
            <p class="card-text" ><h5>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common virus that can affect different parts of your body. There are over 100 types of HPV, including strains of HPV that cause warts on your hands, feet and face. About 30 HPV strains can affect your genitals, including your vulva, vagina, cervix, penis and scrotum, as well as your rectum and anus. This includes the type of HPV that causes genital warts. <br><br>
                HPV that affects your genitals is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that gets passed through skin-to-skin contact, most often during sexual activities. Many people cringe at the thought of STIs, but most genital HPV strains are harmless. <br><br>

                HPV is the most common viral STI in the United States. Roughly 14 million people get the infection each year. HPV is so common that most sexually active people who aren’t vaccinated against HPV will become infected at some point in their lives. Most never know they have it. <br><br>

                    Some strains of HPV are high-risk and can lead to cancers, like cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers. Early detection (with a Pap smear or HPV screening) and treatment of precancerous cells can usually prevent this from happening.

      <h2>How is HPV related to cervical cancer?</h2> <br>
      <h5>Certain strains of HPV (most often types 16 and 18) can cause changes in the cells of your cervix, a condition called cervical dysplasia. Left untreated, cervical dysplasia sometimes advances to cervical cancer. <br><br>

        If you’re under 30, most HPV infections clear up on their own. By age 30, finding HPV during a Pap smear can determine how often you should receive follow-up testing. If you test positive, you may be at a higher risk and need more frequent testing. <br><br>
        
        Getting regular Pap smears to screen for cervical cancer is important (usually beginning at age 21). But it’s important to remember that just because you have HPV or cervical dysplasia doesn’t mean you’ll get cancer. <br><br></h5>


        <h2>How long does it take for HPV to turn into cancer?</h2> <br>
        <h5>The virus itself doesn’t turn into cancer. But high-risk strains of HPV infection can cause precancerous cell changes. These cell changes can eventually lead to cancer if they aren’t managed. This process, though, can take years or decades to happen. Screenings, like Pap smears, can help detect these precancerous cells before they turn to cancer.</h5>

        <h1>Symptoms and Causes</h1><br>
        <h2>What are the symptoms of HPV?</h2><br>
        <h5>HPV that affects your genitals doesn’t usually cause symptoms. When symptoms do occur, the most common sign of the virus is warts in your genital area. Genital warts are rough, cauliflower-like lumps that grow on your skin. They may also appear like skin tags. They may appear weeks, months or even years after you’ve been infected with low-risk HPV. Genital warts are contagious (like all forms of HPV). They can also be itchy and very uncomfortable. <br><br>

            High-risk forms of HPV often don’t cause symptoms until they’ve progressed to cancer.</h5>
