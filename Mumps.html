      <h5>  Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus. It can cause painful swelling in your parotid salivary glands (parotitis). Treatment for mumps focuses on alleviating symptoms. The disease has to run its course. Most symptoms are mild, but serious complications can occur. 
        
          
        Mumps is a contagious disease caused by the mumps virus, which belongs to a group of viruses known as paramyxoviruses. But then it typically leads to severe swelling in certain salivary glands (parotitis) that causes puffy cheeks and a tender, swollen jaw.
        
        After the mumps vaccine became available in 1967, the number of cases reduced significantly. However, mumps outbreaks still occur, especially among people who have prolonged close contact, such as on college campuses.
        
        You can protect your child by having them get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Although mumps is usually a mild disease, serious complications can occur.</h5></p>

<h5>Who does mumps affect?
  Mumps most commonly affects children between the ages of 2 to 12 who haven’t received the mumps vaccine. However, adolescents and adults can get mumps despite being vaccinated against it. This occurs because there’s waning immunity of the vaccine after several years. Still, the best way to protect against mumps infection is to be fully vaccinated.  <br>
  
  <br>. Symptoms and Causes
 . What are the symptoms of mumps?
  The first mumps symptoms are often mild. Many people have no symptoms and don’t know they’re infected. Symptoms also don’t appear right away. The incubation period (the time between infection and illness) ranges from seven to 25 days.  <br>
  
  <br> <b>Mild mumps symptoms may include:</b>  <br>
  
 . Fever.  <br>
 . Headache.  <br>
 . Muscle aches.  <br>
 . Fatigue.  <br>
  Loss of appetite.  <br>
  <br> A few days later, painful swelling of your parotid glands may occur. Your parotid glands are salivary glands located between your ears and jaw. The swelling, known as parotitis, can occur on one or both sides of your face. This classic sign of mumps looks like “chipmunk cheeks” because your cheeks puff up and your jaw swells. Parotitis occurs in more than 70% of mumps cases.
  
  It’s important to remember that many different viruses and bacteria can cause parotitis. So it doesn’t always mean infection by the mumps virus.
  
  Rarely, mumps can affect your organs, including your brain, pancreas, testicles or ovaries. This usually only occurs in adolescents and adults, but call your child’s healthcare provider right away if they develop any of the following severe symptoms:  <br>
  
  <br> . High fever. <br>
  . Stiff neck.  <br>
  . Severe headache.  <br>
  . Confusion. <br>
  . Stomach pain.  <br>
  . Vomiting.  <br>
  . Seizures.  <br>
  . What causes mumps?  <br>
  <br>The mumps virus, which is a type of paramyxovirus, causes mumps. The virus spreads from person to person through direct contact with infected saliva or through respiratory droplets from the infected person’s nose, mouth or throat. The infected person can spread the mumps virus by:
  
  Sneezing, coughing or talking.
  Sharing objects containing infected saliva, such as toys, cups and utensils.
  Playing sports, dancing, kissing or participating in other activities involving close contact with others.
  Some groups of people are at a higher risk of getting mumps. These groups include:  <br>
  
  <br>. People with weakened immune systems.  <br>
 . People who travel internationally.  <br>
 . People who aren’t vaccinated against the virus.  <br>
 . People living in close quarters, such as college campuses  <br>
 . Is mumps contagious?  <br>
 <br> Yes, mumps is a very contagious viral infection. If your child has mumps, they’re contagious from a few days before their glands swell to up to five days after the swelling began. Therefore, your child should minimize contact with others. They shouldn’t go to school or childcare. Up to one-third of people with mumps don’t have any symptoms, but they can still be contagious.  <br>
  
  <br> . Diagnosis and Tests  <br>
 . How is mumps diagnosed?  <br>
 <br> Your child’s healthcare provider will ask questions about your child’s symptoms and perform a physical examination. They may be able to diagnose mumps based on their telltale swollen salivary glands. Your child’s provider may request specific tests to diagnose the condition.
  
  <br>. What tests will be done to diagnose mumps?
  <br> Your child’s healthcare provider may request a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to diagnose mumps. They’ll swab the inside of your child’s cheek or throat to collect a sample of their mucus. They’ll send the sample to a lab, where a pathologist will examine it and look for the mumps virus. Your child’s provider may also request a blood test to help make the diagnosis of mumps or to rule out other conditions and viruses that can cause parotitis.  <br>
  
  <br> <b> Management and Treatment :</b> <br>
   <br>. The treatment for mumps focuses on relieving your child’s symptoms to make them as comfortable as possible. <br>
   <br> . The treatment for mumps focuses on relieving your child’s symptoms. <br>
  . How is mumps treated? <br>
  <br> There’s no specific treatment for mumps. The disease must run its course and usually goes away on its own within a couple of weeks. Mumps treatment focuses on alleviating your child’s symptoms to make them as comfortable as possible. The following steps can help manage symptoms:  <br>
  
  <br> . Drink plenty of fluids. <br>
  . Gargle warm salt water. <br>
  . Eat soft, easy-to-chew foods. <br>
  . Avoid acidic foods that make your mouth water. <br>
  . Suck on an ice pop to soothe a sore throat. <br>
  . Place ice or heat packs on swollen glands. <br>
  . Take non-aspirin medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen to reduce fever and help with pain. <br>
  <br>Don’t give your child aspirin. Children with viruses such as mumps who take aspirin can develop Reye’s syndrome, a dangerous disease that causes liver failure, swelling of their brain and even death.
