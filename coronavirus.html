            <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
            <p>Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which primarily affects the respiratory system. The virus can cause a range of symptoms, from mild or no symptoms at all to severe pneumonia or even death. It spreads mainly through droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or even breathes near others.</p>
            <div class="extra-info">
                <p><strong>COVID-19 Origins:</strong> COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It has since spread globally, leading to a pandemic. The virus belongs to the family of coronaviruses, which includes common colds and other serious respiratory illnesses like MERS and SARS.</p>

            <div class="extra-info">
                <p><strong>Severe Symptoms:</strong> In severe cases, COVID-19 can cause difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, and bluish lips or face, which may require immediate medical attention. Vulnerable groups, such as older adults or those with underlying health conditions, are more likely to experience severe symptoms.</p>

            <h2>Prevention</h2>
            <p>There are several important measures you can take to protect yourself and reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wear a mask, especially in indoor and crowded settings.</li>
                <li>Practice social distancing, keeping at least 6 feet away from others.</li>
                <li>Wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</li>
                <li>Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
                <li>Stay home if you're sick or have been in contact with someone who is unwell.</li>
                <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="extra-info">
                <p><strong>Quarantine & Isolation:</strong> If you've been exposed to COVID-19, it's crucial to follow quarantine guidelines to prevent spreading the virus. Individuals who are infected with COVID-19 should isolate themselves until they are no longer contagious.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Vaccination</h2>
            <p>Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself from severe illness caused by COVID-19. Vaccines stimulate your immune system to recognize and fight the virus if exposed. As of 2024, several COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for emergency use and widespread distribution.</p>
            <p>Vaccines not only protect the individual but also help reduce transmission, contributing to herd immunity and protecting vulnerable populations.</p>
            <div class="extra-info">
                <p><strong>Types of COVID-19 Vaccines:</strong> There are different types of COVID-19 vaccines, including mRNA vaccines (like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna), viral vector vaccines (like Johnson & Johnson), and protein subunit vaccines. Each has been proven effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death.</p>
